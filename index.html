                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                  I'm an artist with a lifelong passion for creativity, from exploring different mediums in college to volunteering with AmeriCorps and spreading joy at Disney World. My love for animals and nature inspires my detailed animal portraits and landscape work, and when I'm not creating, I’m volunteering with animals or enjoying the outdoors. Currently, I’m transitioning into a tech career, excited to blend my artistic skills with new technology. I'm looking forward to sharing my art and collaborating on something beauti/li with you!
